As some students are asking about the types and tips regarding the QE exam of Digital Image Processing, I'm sending this message to clarify.

Refer the screenshot of the first page of the exam for the number and types of questions.
The exam will cover topics listed in the syllabus.
Please refer to the zip file which contains lecture slides on matching, color and image restoration, supplementing the available slides at moodle. The exam might have questions on these topics.
The exam focus on testing your understanding of important concepts and rationale, and ability to apply fundamental tools to solve basic problems. So you don't need to memorize formula.
